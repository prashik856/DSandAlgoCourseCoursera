IP Addresses

Suppose we have a Web Service:
In such networking, we actually assign an address to each computer connected to
our Web Service.
This is IP.
0-255 value: xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx
There are 2^32 different IP Addresses. This is roughly 4Billion.
Due to this, we have designed a new address system, 
2^128 IPv6 addresses - number with 39 digits!
This will be sufficient for a long time.


Access Log File:
Whenever some one connects to our web service, we store the IP address of
that computer in our file system in a file called as Access log file.
Uses Access Log, we can analyze all the activities.
We need to use this since someone can attack our Web service with 
mal intention, or he can send lots and lots of service to a server
to block other from receiving any service. [Denial of Service Attack]

Access Log
It usually store these values,
Date    Time    IPaddress

IP Access List:
Analyse the access log and quickly answer queries:
did anybody access the service from this IP during the last hour?
How many times?
How many IPs were used to access the service during the last hour?


Log Processing:
> 1h of logs can contain millions of lines
> Too slow to process that for each query
> Keep count: How many times each IP apprears in the last 1h of the access log.
> C is ome data structure to store the mapping from IPs to counters.
> We will learn later how to implement C

We will update C according too IP addresses every second.
> Decrement counter for all the IPs where were in our Access Log 1 hour ago.

MainLoop()
log - array of log lines (time, IP)
C - mapping from IPs to counters
i - first unprocessed log line
j - first line in current 1h window
i <- 0
j <- 0
C <- None
Each second
    UpdateAccessList(log,i,j,C)

UpdateAccessList(log,i,j,C):
while log[i].time <= Now():
    C[log[i].IP] <- C[log[i].IP] + 1
    i <- i + 1
while log[j].time <= Now() - 3600:
    C[log[j].IP] <- C[log[j].IP] - 1
    j <- j + 1

AccessedLastHour(IP,C)
return C[IP] > 0

But, how to implement the mapping C?
