Overview:
Input is sequence of elements: A[1,2,....,n]
Output: Need the sequence in non-decreasing order: Permutation A'[1,2,...,n] of A[1...n] in non decreasing order.

Why Sorting?
-> Sorting data is an important step of many efficient algorithms.
-> Sorted data allows more efficient queries.

All Sorting algorithms are:
Insertion
Selection
Bubble
Shell
Merge
Heap
