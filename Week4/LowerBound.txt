Lower Bound for Comparison Based Sorting:

Definition:
A Comparison based sorting algorithm sorts objects by comparing pairs of them.

Example:
Selection sort and merge sort are comparison based.

Lemma:
Any comparison based sorting algorithm performs O(nlogn) comparisons in the worst case to sort n objects.

In other words:
For any comparison based sorting algorithm, there exists an array A[1....n] such that the algorithm performs at least O(nlogn) comparisons to sort A.

Decision Tree:
Our algorithm can be shown on a decision tree.
