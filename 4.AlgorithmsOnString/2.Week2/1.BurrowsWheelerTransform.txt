BURROWS WHEELER TRANSFORM


- Text Compression by Run-Length Encoding
- Run Length encoding compresses a run of n identical symbols:

Idea: Converting Repeats to Runs

How do we do it?


Forming all cyclic rotations of example:

Sorting Cyclic Rotations:
BWT(panamabananas$) = smnpbnnaaaaa$a
The last column is Burrows-Wheeler Transform 

Apply BWT To the Double Helix Paper.

"and" is frequent repeat in English texts


Genome -> Convert repeats to runs -> BWT (Genome) -> run length encoding -> Compression(BWT(Genome))

Is it even possible to go back from BWT to original String?
