Inverting Burros Wheeler Transform

Reconstruction banana from annb$aa
We also know first column:
Sorting all elements of "annb$aa" gives first column of BWT matrix

- Thus we know 2-mer composition of circular string banana$
-> Sorting this 2-mer gives us the first 2 columns of the matrix

-> Now, since we got first 2 columns, by looking by BWM, we will get the last column as well.

-> We now know 3-mer composition of circular string banana$.
-> Sorting gives us the first 3 columns of the matrix

We continue with 4-mer to 5-mer to n-mer.

Thus, we now know the entire matrix.


-> More Memory Issues
	Reconstruction Text from BWT(Text) required us to store |Text| cyclic rotations of Text.

-> A Strange Observation
Where is first "a" hiding inside the circle?
Where is first "a" hindig inside the circle?
Is it True in General?

First-Last Property:
- The kth occurance of symbol in First Column and the kth occurence of symbol in lastColumn correspond to appearance of symbol at the same position in Text.

- Inverting BWT Again
Memory: 2*Text
Time: O(Text)
