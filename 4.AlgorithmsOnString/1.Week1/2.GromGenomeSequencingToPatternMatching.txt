FROM GENOME SEQUENCING TO PATTERN MATCHING

Suffix Trees:

The Newspaper Problem?
	The newspaper Problem as an overlapping puzzle
	Million of Copies of a Genome
	Breaking the Genomes at Random Positions
	Generate Short Substring (Reads)
	Burning Some Reads
	Assembling Genome

Why do we sequence 1000s of species?
	Applications in 
		- medicine (mouse genome)
		- agriculture 
		- biotechnology 

- Few Mutations can make a Big Difference

- Emergence of Personalized Medicine
	
- From Reference Genome to personal Genomes
	Reference human genome assembled in 2000

Exact Pattern Matching:
	Where does a read match the reference genome exactly?
	Approximate Pattern Matching Problem:
	Input: A string pattern, a string Text, and integer d
	Output: All positions in Text where Patterns appears as a substring with at most d mismatches.

Multiple Pattern Matching?
	Where do billions of reads match the reference genome?
Multiple Pattern matching problem:
	Input: A set of strings patterns and a string text
	Output: All positions in Text where a string from patterns appears as a substring
