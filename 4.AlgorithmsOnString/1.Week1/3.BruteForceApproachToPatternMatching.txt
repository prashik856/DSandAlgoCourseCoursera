Brute Force Approach to Pattern Matching

Genome:

Pattern drives along Text

panamabananas : Text
nana : Pattern
Pattern Found!

Brute Force Approach is Fast!
single Pattern: O(Text * Pattern)
The runtime of knuth-morris-pratt algorithm in O("Text") time

Brute force approach is slow for billions of patterns

For human Genome, it will be impossible
