SUFFIX TREES

From Suffix Tries to Suffix Trees?

SuffixTree(Text):
Since each suffix adds one leaf and at most one internal vertex to the suffix tree:
vertices < 2*T
Memory footprint of the suffix tree: O(|Text|)

Cheating: How do we store all edge labels?

Storing edge Labels?

We did we bother to add $ to panamabananas?

	- To make sure that each suffix corresponds to a leaf

Constructing Suffix Tree: Naive Approach?

- Quadratic runtime:
	O(|Text|^2)

Linear runtime (for a constant -size alphabet)
	- O(|Text|)

Big Secret of the Big O Notation:
	- Suffix trees enable fast Exact Multiple Pattern Matching:
		Runtime : O(|Text| + |Patterns|)
		Memory: O(|Text|)
	However, big O notations hides constants
		suffix tree algorithms has large memory footprint 20*T for long text like human genome
	We want to find mutations?
