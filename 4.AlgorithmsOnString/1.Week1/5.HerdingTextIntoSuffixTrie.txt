Herding Text into Suffix Trie:

New Idea: Packing Text into a Bus
	Generate all suffixes of Text
	Form a trie out of these suffixes (suffix trie)
	For each pattern, check if it can be spelled out from the root downward in the suffix trie

Example
Panamabananas

We Create a SuffixTrie()
	Add dollar at the end of Text
	Start from the first index, and create a Trie for the text.
	go to second index, repeat.
	Repeat till we reach the end of Text.
	We will have a SuffixTrie

Where Are the Matches?
	Idea: to find the positions of matches, add some information to leaves
	We can add the value of dollar as the position of all the leaves

Walking Down to the leaves to find Matches?
	Once we find a match, we "walk down" to the leaf (or leaves) in order to find starting position of the match.
	How many times did this pattern appear?
	This can be solved by walking down to all trees


Memory Footprint of Suffix Trie
the suffix trie is formed from |Text| suffixes with total length:
|Text|*(|Text| - 1)/2

For human genome:
Text = 10^12!
Impossible for human genomes
