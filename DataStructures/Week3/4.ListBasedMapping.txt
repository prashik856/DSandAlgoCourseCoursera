LIST-BASED MAPPING:
-> Direct addressing requires too much memory
-> Let's just store active IPs
-> Store them in a list soretd by time of access

UpdateAccessList(log,i,L):
while log[i].time <= Now():
    L.append(log[i]) // Storing ip address and time of access
    i <- i + 1
while L.Top().time <= Now() - 3600:
    L.Pop()

AccessedHastHour(IP,L)
return L.FindByIP(IP) != Null

AccessCountLastHour(IP, L)
return L.CountIP(IP)

Asymptotics:
n is number of active IPs
Memory usage is O(n)
L.Append, L.Top, L.Pop are O(1)
UpdateAccessList is O(1) per log line
L.FindByIP and L.CountIP are O(n)
AccessedLastHour and AccessCountLastHour are O(n)
