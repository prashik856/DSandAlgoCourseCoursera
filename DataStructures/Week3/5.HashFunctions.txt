Encoding IPs
:Encode Ips with small numbers
I.e numbers from 0 to 99
Different codes for currently active IPs

Let's define a hash function
Definition:
For any set of objects S and any integer m>0, a function h: S -> {0,1,....,m-1} is called a hash-function
So, h(S) has a Range of {0,m-1}

m is called the cardinality of hash function h.


Desirable Properties:
-> h should be fast to compute
-> Different values for different objects
-> Direct addressing with O(m) memory
-> Want small cardinality m
-> Impossible to have all different values if number of objects |S| is more than m.


Definition:
when h(o1) = h(o2) and o1!=o2, this is a collision
