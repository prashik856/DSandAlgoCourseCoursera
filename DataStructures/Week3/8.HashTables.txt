HASH TABLES

Set
Definition:
Set is a data structure with methods Add(O), Remove(O), Find(O)


Example:
IPs accessed durint last hour

Implementing Set
Two ways to implement a set using chaining:
-> Set is equivalent to map from S to V = {true, false}
-> Store just Objects O instead of pairs (O,v) in chains


h: S -> {0,1,...m-1}
O,O' belongs to S
A <- array of m lists (chains) of objects O
Find(O):
L <- A[h(O)]
for O' in L:
    if O'==O:
        return true
return false


Add(O):
L <- A[h(O)]
for O' in L:
    if O' == O:
        return
L.Append(O)

Remove(O):
if not Find(O):
    return
L <- A[h(O)]
L.Erase(O)


Hash Table:
Definition:
An implementation of a set or a map using hashing is called a hash table.


Programming Languages:
Set:
    unordered_set in C++
    HashSet in Java
    set in Python
Map:
    unordered_map in C++
    HashMap in Java
    dict in Python

Conclusion:
-> chaining is a technique to implement a hash table
-> memory consumption is O(n+m)
-> Operations work in time O(c+1)
-> how to make both m and c small?
