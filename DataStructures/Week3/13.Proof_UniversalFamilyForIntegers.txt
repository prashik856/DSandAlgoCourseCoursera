Theorem:
Set of functions
Hp = {h(p)(a,b)(x) = ((ax + b) mod p) mod m)} with parameters
a,b:1<=a<=p-1, 0<=b<=p-1
and prime p is a universal family for U={0,1,...,p-1}


Lemma:
For a fixed hash function h = h(p)(a,b) from Hp and keys x,y belongs to U, x!=y, the values
r = (ax + b) mod p
and s = (ay + b) mod p
are different

Proof by Contradiction:
r = s => (ax + b) === (ay + b) mod p => 
a(x-y) === 0 mod p => p divides a(x-y)
Since P is a prime number, p either divides a or either p divides x-y
1 <= a <= p-1 => p divides (x-y)
p cannot divide a.
but, 0<=x,y<p, p divides (x-y) => x = y
Only value for x-y possible is 0.
But this contradicts that x != y.

Corollary
There are no collisions for
h(x) = (ax + b) mod p, before taking the value mod m.


Lemma:
For fixed keys x!=y, there is one to one correspondence between pairs.
(a,b), 1<=a<=p-1, 0<=b<=p-1 and 
(r,s), 0<=r,s<=p-1, r!=s

Proof:
Different (a,b) generate different (r,s)
this is because
a = ((r-s)((x-y)^(-1) mod p)mod p),
b = (r-ax) mod p
r = r', s = s' => a = a', b = b'.

Now, we know
Different (a,b) generates different (r,s)
p(p-1) total pairs (a,b)
p(p-1) total pairs (r,s)
Thus one to one correspondence


Corollary:
if x and y, x!=y, are some keys, any h belongs to Hp is chosen at random with equal probablitly
1/p(p-1), then each pairs of values
(r,s) = ((ax + b) mod p, (ay + b) mod p)
happen with equal probability 1/p(p-1)

There is one to one correspondence between (a,b) and (r,s)
Probability of any pair (a,b) is 1/p(p-1)
So probability of any (r,s) is 1/p(p-1)

Proof of the Theorem:
Pr[h(x)=h(y)] = Pr[r mod m = s mod m]
Each pair (r,s) has probabllity 1/p(p-1)
For each r=[0,p-1], there are at most ceil(p/m)-1 such s that s != r, and r mod m = s mod m.
0,1,...m,...,2m,....(ceil(p/m)-1)m,....

Now, 
Pr[r mod m = s mod m] <= sum(r=0 to p-1) (ceil(p/m)-1)/p(p-1) 
= (ceil(p/m)-1)/p-1 <= ((p+m-1)/m -1)/(p-1) = (p-1)/m(p-1) = 1/m
So, Pr[h(x)=h(y)] <= 1/m


Conclusion:
Proven universal family for integers
Proven 1 + alpha bound for expected chain length
proven O(1) amortized expected running time of hash table operations
