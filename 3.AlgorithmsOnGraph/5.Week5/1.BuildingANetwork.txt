BUILDING A NETWORK

- Connecting computers by wires

- Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
Input: A connected, undirected graph G = (V,E) with positive edge weights
Output: A subset of edges E' i E of minimum total weight such that the graph (V,E')  is connected.

- Properteis of Trees 
    - A tree is an undirected graph that is connected and acyclic
    - A tree of n vertices has n-1 edges.
    - Any connected undirected graph 
    G(V,E) with E = V - 1 is a tree.
    - An undirected graph is a tree iff there is a unique path between any pair of its vertices.
