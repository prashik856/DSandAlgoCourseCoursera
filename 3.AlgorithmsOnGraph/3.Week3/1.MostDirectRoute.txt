MOST DIRECT ROUTE

- Applications
	Navigation
	Network package data 
	Currency Exchange

- Most Direct Route Problem?
	Minimum nuber of flight segments to get from humburg ro moscow

- We can consider it to to be a graph problem

- Paths and Legths
	L(P) is the number of edges in the path

- Distances
	Distance between two vertices is the length of shortest path between them
	distance(directed) >= distance(undirected)	
- Finding distance between a node to all other nodes

- We use distance Layers for this
	Distance between layers

- Directed Case will have different distance layers depending on the directions
	 Here layers can be added from any node to the root but we need to take care of the direction.
