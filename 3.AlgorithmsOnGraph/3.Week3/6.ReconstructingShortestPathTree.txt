RECONSTRUCTION SHORTEST PATH:

ReconstructPath(S,u,prev):
result = empty
while u != S:
	result.append(u)
	u = prev[u]
return Reverse(result)

- Conclusion
	Can find the minimum nuber of flight segments to get from one city to another
	Can reconstruct the optimal path
	Can build the tree of shortest paths from one origin
	Works in O(E + V)
