Efficient algo to get distances

- Initially we set the distances to INF

- If nodes are not reachable from a node, the distance to that node will be INF

- Directed and Undirected graph will always have different outcomes

- We will use a queue

- When we discover a node, we put it in the queue, when we take it out from the queue, we process it.

- Distance to root is always 0.

- Process - get all the neighbours of the current vertex

- When we discover the neighbours, we set their distance at that time too.
