LANDMARKS

Lemma:
    Fix some vertex A in V, we will call it a landmark.
    Then the potential p(v) = d(A, t) - d(A,v) is feasible and p(t) = 0.

Landmarks 
- Select several landmarks and precompute their distances 
to all other vertices.
- For any landmark A,
d(v,t) >= d(A,t) - d(A,v)
d(v,t) >= d(v,A) - d(t, A)


- Landmark selection
    Choosing landmarks on the border seems reasonable.

Conclusion:
    Directed search can scan fewer vertices.
    A* is a directed search algorithm baased on 
    dijktra and potential functions 
    A* can also be Bidirectional
    Euclidean distance is a potential for a plane(road networks)
    Landmarks can be used foir good potential function, 
    but we need preprocessing to use them.
