BI-DIRECTIONAL DIJKSTRA

- Dijkstra Reminder
	To find the shortest path from s to t
	Initialize dist[s] to 0, all other distances to INF
	ExtractMIN- choose unprocessed u with the smallest distance[u]
	Process u - Relax the edges outgoing from u
	Repeat until t is processed


- Reversed Graph
	Reverse graph GR for a graph G is the graph with the same set of vertices V and the set of reversed edges ER, such that any edge(u,v) in E there is an edge(v,u) in ER and vice versa.

- Bidirectional Dijkstra
	- Build GR
	- Start Dijkstra from s in G and from t in GR
	- Alternate between Dijkstra steps in G and in GR
	- Stop when some vertex v is processed both in G and in GR
	- Compute the shortest path between s and t


Computing Distance
	- let v be the first vertex which is processed both in G and in GR. Does it follow there is a shortest path from s to t going through v?
	- This is not the case
