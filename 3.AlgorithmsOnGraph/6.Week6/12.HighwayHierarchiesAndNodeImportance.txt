HIGHWAY HIERARCHIES AND NODE IMPORTANCE

Highway Hierarchies :
- Long distance trips go through highways
- To get from A to B, first merge into highway, then into 
a bigger highway, etc. Then exit to a highway, then exit to a street, then go to B.
- less important roads merge into more important roads.
- Hierarchy of roads.
- There are algorithms based on this idea.
- Highway Hierarchies and Transit Node Routing.
- Millions of times faster than Dijkstras 
Pretty Complex.


Node Ordering:
- Nodes can be ordered by some importance.
- Importance first increases, then decreases back along any shortest path.
- E.g. points where highway merges into another highway
- Can use Bidirectional search.

Importance Ideas:
Many shortest paths involve important nodes.
Important nodes are spread around.
Important nodes are sometimes unavoidable.

Shortest Paths with Preprocessing.
- Preprocess the graph.
- Find distance and shortest path in preprocessed graph.
- Reconstruct the shortest path in the initial graph.
