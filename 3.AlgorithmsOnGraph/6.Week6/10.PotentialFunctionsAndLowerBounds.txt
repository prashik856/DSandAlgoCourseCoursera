POTENTIAL FUNCTIONS AND LOWER BOUNDS

Lemma:
If p is feasible and p(t) <= 0, then p(v) <= d(v,t) for any v 

Proof:
    lp(x,y) >= 0 for any x,y, so lp(P) >= 0 for any path P 
    Take a v-t shortest path, P = (v,w1,w2,w3,...,wk,t)
    
Euclidean Potential:
    p(v) = dE(v,t) = sq.root((v.x - t.x)^2 + (v.y - t.y)^2)
    and p(t) = 0;
    distance funtion is a good potential function.

Proof that it is a good potential:


A* on a Plane map:
Need to find the shortest path from s to t.
For each v, compute p(v) = de(v,t)
launch Dijkstra with potentials p(v)
