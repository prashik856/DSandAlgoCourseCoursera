SIX HANDSHAKES

- Small World Conjecture
- Can pass a message from any person to any person in at most 6 handshakes
- This is close to truth according to experiments and is called a six handshakes

- Facebook
	- Suppose an average person has around 100 Facebook friends
	- then 10000 friedns of friends
	- 1000000 friends of friends of friends
	- 100000000 friends of friends of friends of friends
	- 10000000000 friends of friends of friends of friends of friends
	- 1,000,000,000,000 friends of friends of friends of friends of friends of friends
	- 1 Trillion people at six handshakes
	- not possible, as there are only 7 billions on earth

Facebook:
	Find the shortest path from Michael to Bob via friends connections
	- for the two farthest people, dijkstra has to look through 2 billion people
	- if we only consider friends of friends of friends for both michael and bob, we will find a connection.
	- Rough 1M friends of friends of friends
	- 1M + 1M = 2M people - 1000 times less
	

- Meet in the middle
	- More general idea, not just the graphs
	- Instead of searching for all possible objects, search for first halves and for second halves separately
	- Then find "compatible" halves
	- Typically roughly O(sqroot(N)) instead of O(N), including the previous Facebook


Conclusion:
	- Dijkstra goes in circle
	- Bidirectional search idea can reduce the search space
	- Roughly 2x speedup for road networks
	- meet in the middle - sqroot(N) instead of N
	- 1000 times faster for social networks
