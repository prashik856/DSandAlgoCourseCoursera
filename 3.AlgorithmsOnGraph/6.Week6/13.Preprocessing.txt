PREPROCESSING.

- Preprocessing 
    Eliminate nodes one by one in some order
    Add shortcuts to preserve distances
    Output: augmented graph + node order 

- Node Contraction

- Witness Paths
    Contraction of node v
    For every pair of edges (u,v), (v,w) 
    add a new edge (u,w)
    l(u,w) = l(u,v) + l(v,w)
    But only if there is no witness path Puw shorter thatn l(u,v) + l(v,w) and bypassing v.
