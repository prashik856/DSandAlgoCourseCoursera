GRAPH ALGORITHMS

Learning Objectives:
- Provide examples of the types of objects modelled by graphs
- Understand the formal definition of a graph
- Draw and read pictures of graphs


Graphs:
- Represents connection between objects
- Describe many important phenomena


E.g  The Internet
The Webpages conencted by links:
This is important for Google's page rank.

Another Example: Maps
Intersections connected by roads.

Social Networks: People connected by friendships

Configured Spaces: Possible configurations connected by motions.

Formal Definition:
An (undiredted) Graph is a collection V of vertices, and a collection E of edges each of which connects a pair of vertices.


Drawing Graphs:
Vertices: Points
Edges: Lines

B -- A -- C -- D -- A (This represents A is connected to D)

Vertices: A, B, C ,D
Edges: (A, B), (A, C), (A, D), (C, D)


Loops and Multiple Edges: Loops connect a vertex to itself.

Multiple edges between same vertices.

If a graph has neither, it is simple.
