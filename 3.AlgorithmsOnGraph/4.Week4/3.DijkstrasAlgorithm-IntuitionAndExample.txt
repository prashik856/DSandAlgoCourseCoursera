DIJKSTRA'S ALGORITHM: INTUITION AND EXAMPLE

Find shortest path from one vertex to all other nodes in the graph

- Intuition
	S is vertex
	relax all the edges from S
	Let's relax all the edges of the children now

- Main ideas of Dikstra's Algorithm
	- We maintain a set R of vertices for which dist is already set correctl

- Example:
