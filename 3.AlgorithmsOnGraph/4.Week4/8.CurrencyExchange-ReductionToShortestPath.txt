CURRENCY EXCHANGE : REDUCTION TO SHORTEST PATHS


Recution to shortest paths:
	Use two standard approaches
	Replace product with sum by taking logatithms of weights
	Negate weights to solve minimization instead of maximization

Taking Logarithm:
	x*y = log(x) + log(y)
	max -> log2(x) + log2(y)
	logs can be both positive and negative
	In general, in order to maximize the product of k numbers is the same as maximizing the sum of logs of those k numbers
	Need to take care of zero when taking log

Negation:
	maximize sum is the same as minimum of negative values
	Minimize the sum of negative log

- Reduction:
	Replace each weights rei by -log(rei)

- Solved?
	Use Dijkstra's algorithm now

- Where does dijkstra's algorithm goes wrong?
	Does not take care of negative values
	Same goes for currency exchange values
	We cannot just apply Dijkstra's algo to solve this problem

- Negative Weight cycles?
	d(S,A) = d(S,B) = d(S,C) = d(S,D) = -INF
	Negative weight cycles
	just go round and round to decrease the weights till infinity
	A negative cycle can make us a billionaire.
