BELLMAN-FORD ALGORITHM

Naive Algorithm:
- Remember naive algo
- Relax adges while dist changes
- Turns our it works even for negative edge weights


Bellman-ford algorithm
BellmanFord(G,S):
{no negative weight cycles in G}:
for all u in V:
	dist[u] = INF
	prev[u] = nil
dist[S] = 0
repeat V - 1 times:
	for all (u,v) in E:
		Relax(u,v)

- Running
	Running time is O(VE)

- Proof:
	Initialize dist - O(V)
	V - 1 iterations each O(E) - O(VE)

- Example:
