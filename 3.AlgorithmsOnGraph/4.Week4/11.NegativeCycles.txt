NEGATIVE CYCLE

Negative weight cycles:
	A graph G contains a negative weight cycle iff Vth (additional) iteration of BellmanFord(G,S) updates some distance value

- Proof
	
- Proof2
	If there's a negative weight cycle, say a-b-c-a, but no relaxations on Vth iteration
	dist[b] <= dist[a] + w(a,b)
	dist[c] <= dist[b] + w(b,c)
	dist[a] <= dist[c] + w(c,a)
	add all
	w(a,b) + w(b,c) + w(c,a) >= 0 = contradiction, since negative cycle

- Finding Negative Cycle
Algorithm:
	Run V iterations of Bellmanford algorithm, save node v relaxed on the last iteration

	v is reachable from a negative cycle
	Start from x <- x, follow the link x<-prev[x] for V times - will be definitely on the cycle

	Save y<-x and go x<-prev[x] until x = u again
