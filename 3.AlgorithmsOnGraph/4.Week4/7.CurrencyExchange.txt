	Determined by the product of the conversion rate

- What are the possibilities of exchanges
	- We can use graphs to represent this

Input: Current exchange graph with weighted directed edges ei, between some pairs of currencies with weights rei, corresponding to the exchange rate

Output: Maximize the product over paths e1,e2...ek from USD to RUR in graph
