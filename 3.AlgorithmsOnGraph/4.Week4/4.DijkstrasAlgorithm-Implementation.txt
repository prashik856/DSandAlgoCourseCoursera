DIJKSTRA'S ALGORITHM - IMPLEMENTATION

Psuedocode:
Dijkstra(G, S):
for all u in V:
	dist[u] = INF;
	prev[u] = null;
dist[s] = 0;
H = MakeQueue(V) {dist-values as keys} // priority queue
// Extract minimum value from it
// To change the dist value in H
// Once minimum value is extracted, we need to remove the extracted node from the priority queue
while H is not empty:
	u = extractMin(H)
	for all (u,v) in E: // for all neighbours of u
		if dist[v] > dist[u] + w(u,v):
			dist[v] = dist[u] + w(u,v)
			prev[v] = u
			ChangePriority(H, v, dist[v])
			// change value of v in our datastructure
