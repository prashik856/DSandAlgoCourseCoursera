STRONGLY CONNECTED COMPONENTS

- Learning Objectives

- Connectivity in Digraphs

- Examples:

- Possible Notions

- Strongly connected components: One vertex is reachable from another

- Problem Solution: A, B, E, F, G, H

- Result: 

- MetaGraph: How the strongly connected components connects to one another

- MetaGraph is a DAG
