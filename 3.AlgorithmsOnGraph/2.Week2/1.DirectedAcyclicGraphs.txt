DIRECTED ACYCLIC GRAPHS

Learning Graphs:

- Directed Graphs

- Examples

- Directed DFS
	Only follow directed edges

- Another example: Morning Routine

- Linear Ordering

- Chicken And Eggs problem
Cannot put order


- Cycles

- If cycle is present, it cannot be linearly Ordered

- Proof that cycle cannot be linearly ordered.

- To be linearly Orderable, a directed graph G needs to be a Directed Acyclic Graph.

Is it sufficient?

- Theorem : Any DAG can be linearly ordered
