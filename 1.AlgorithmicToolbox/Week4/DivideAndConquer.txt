1) Main Idea:
Deal with smaller group than one large group.

A problem to solve:
-> Break into non-overlapping subproblems of the same type as the original.
-> Divide and solver each subproblem.
-> Combine the result into original subproblem.
-> Since each subproblem is of same type, we can solve each problem recursively.
-> We can also write using iteration using recurtion.

Summary: 
Break into non-overlapping subproblems of the same type
Solve subproblems
Combine results
