Algorithm Design is Hard.
Algorithms solve many different problems.
No unified technique.
No Generic procedure to create an algorithms.
Finding Algorithm often requires unique insights.

What can we teach you?
    -> Practive desighning algorithms
    -> Common tools used in algorithm design.
    -> Greedy Algorithm
    -> Divide and Conquer
    -> Dynamic Programming

Levels of Design:
Naive Algorithm: Definition to algorithm (slow)
Algorithm by way of standard Tools: (standard techniques)
Optimized Algorithm: Improve existing algorithm
Magic Algorithm: Unique insight

The Rest of the Course:
Each Unit covers a technique
Exercise help build intuition.
