Our Input is an array of integers (positive integers).
Our goal is to get the pair of numbers which will get maximum value when multiplied.

1) IN:
3
1 2 3

OUT: 
6

2) IN:
10
7 5 14 2 

If input is 100000 90000, we will get some random number
(Due to integer overflow)

//Fixing it by using (long long) for result.
This is using naive method with two for loops.
Out input is of size 10^5, there are two for loops, so, it is running for 10^10 iterations. And 10^10 need more than a second to compute. 

//Rather than using naive input, we using improved method.
What we actually need is to get two maximum numbers.
// We now using our code to first find maximum numbers and output their product.

//To get the running time for any program
We need to import time.

//Well, event this new logic won't work and it will give error for some inputs (Why?).

STRESS TESTING:
What is stress testing?
Generates two solutions using random tests. Test our two inputs and check which of the test is giving a wrong answer, and another is giving a correct answer.
Very important to consider this when we are getting wrong answers.
