1) The Big O Notation:
Understand why finding exact runtimes is a problem.

RUNTIME ANALYSIS:
Last time, for fibonacci algo, we thought we run 2n+2 lines of code.
To initialize our array, Depends on memory management system.
After that, we are assigning values to our array (0 and 1).
After that, we have a for loop. We have increment, comparison and branch.
Inside for loop, we have lookup, assignment, addition of big integers.
After for loop, we are returning the value.
